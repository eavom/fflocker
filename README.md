# FFLocker

FFLocker was a fun project when i was learning batch file programming. This was built in 2014 with an idea of locking/unlocking folders/files through batch file. The more fun while building this project was a good GUI. One way other it's not actual GUI it's more of command line but works pretty well to make a user fill like a good UI.
